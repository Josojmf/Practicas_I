1. Pull the image:
   ```bash
   docker pull josojmf/practicas-i-int:17-12-2024
   ```

2. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following content:

   ```yaml
   version: "3.8"

   services:
     web:

       container_name: practicas-1-int
       ports:
         - "5000:5000"
       environment:
         DB_USERNAME: joso
         DB_PASSWORD: test123
         DB_CLUSTER: mongo
         DB_NAME: Practicas_I_Automation_Project
         DB_USERS_COLLECTION: Users
       depends_on:
         - mongo

     mongo:
